We're happy to announce that [Rhino 3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/) now has CityJSON support via [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/). 
The GH plugin consists out off a small set of components that can expose and bake the stored data. 
The format in which the data is exposed enables easy integration with both native GH components and other powerful plugins, for example [Ladybug](https://www.ladybug.tools/).

The pre-build plugin can be found on [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/rhino-cityjson), and the [code is open-source](https://github.com/cityjson/RhinoCityJSON).
