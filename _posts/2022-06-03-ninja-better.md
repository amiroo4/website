The official web-viewer for CityJSON files has been improving a lot recently.

If you haven't used it in a while, you'll be surprised, you can now:

- see selected semantic surface information in the information panel
- highlight only the selected surface
- select which LoD to display if your file has more than one (this was often requested)
- see your Geometry Template objects
- better seen you Extension objects.
