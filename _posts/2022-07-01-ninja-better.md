The [official web-viewer for CityJSON files](https://ninja.cityjson.org) has been improving a lot recently.

If you haven't used it in a while, you'll be surprised, you can now:

- see selected semantic surface information in the information panel
- highlight only the selected surface
- select which LoD to display if your file has more than one (this was often requested)
- better see your Extension objects
- and several small improvements!
