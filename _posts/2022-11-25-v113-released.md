Patch release where the schemas are essentially the same, and where the text of the specs is better/sharper.

### Changed 

- CityJSONFeatures now do not have to dereference the GeometryTemplates, those can be in the "1st line"/metadata. Dereferencing is still allowed. cjio passes the GeometryTemplates in the 1st-line now. 
- `CityJSONFeature`: now clear that all children (recursively) of a feature should be bundled with its parent.
- improved the text of the specifications at several places, and fixed sentences that were not precise enough.
- change the `"uri"` to `"url"` for the Extensions, and now the schemas can have either of these. Going forward `"url"` is the preferred way.
- restructured the text for the Extensions, now a 4th use-case is added: "Defining a new Semantic Object". It was always there but not listed as a case. Now fixed.

### Added

- `"BuildingConstructiveElement"` was missing from the schemas as a CO, now added.
- added 2 suggested conventions in the specs: file extensions `.city.json` and `.city.jsonl`
