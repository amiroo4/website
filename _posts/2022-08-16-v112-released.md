Minor changes to the schemas for errors, improved the text of the specs so that it's easier for everyone to read and understand.

What changed: 

  - fixed the typo in the schema: `"TunnelFurniture"`
  - added the missing CityGML v3 types in the schemas: `"BridgeFurniture"` and `"Waterway"` and `"BuildingConstructiveElement"`
  - added a link in the specs text to the official CityGML v3 specs for definitions of each of the City Objects
  - improved and added a few sentences in the specs to make them clearer
  - small improvements in the specs document to make concepts clearer
  - schemas are the same, with some simplifications to make their maintenance easier in the future
